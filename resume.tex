{ \large \textbf{Employment:} } & 

\textbf{Cisco Meraki, SF, CA}  (Senior Software Engineer) & \textbf{March 2021 - Present} \\
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\parbox{\middleboxsize}{ \begin{itemize} 
\item Implemented a monitoring class that captured IOS-XE logs, correctly modelling the underlying state of the architecture based on partial information, then propogating it via Protobuf to the UI
\item Facilitated cross-team collaboration between four or more teams, allowing a feature to be executed that required a portion of the implementation on multiple different platforms
\item Managed a number of high-priority bugs on a week-to-week basis, selecting and resolving new tasks over rolling sprints
\end{itemize} } } \\
& \textbf{Riverbed Technology, SF, CA}  (Software Engineer) & \textbf{October 2016 - February 2021} \\
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\parbox{\middleboxsize}{ \begin{itemize} 
\item Added both virtual and hardware interfaces to the abstraction layer for capturing network traffic, allowing traffic capture on AWS (virtual) and 40/100Gbit fiber (hardware) interfaces
\item Fine tuned several API functions, letting us export over several hundred time ranges at once instead of opening a socket for each, turning an operation which took minutes into seconds
\item Created hardware-specific profiles that forced certain processes on to certain CPUs in a multi-CPU system, ensuring the capture card was directly tied to the CPU
\item Added forced compiler checks that ensure success/fail return values are being consumed
\item Repackaged neccesary open-source software for our custom Redhat-based distribution
\item Cleared a considerable amount of legacy code that required explicitly initializing/deinitializing objects, letting the constructor do the work
\item Participated in regular code review and improvement, as well as triaging and reprioritizing bugs, assigning and updating estimates
\end{itemize} } } \\
& \textbf{Elk Products, Hickory, NC}  (Software Engineering Intern) & \textbf{May 2013 - October 2016} \\
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\parbox{\middleboxsize}{ \begin{itemize} 
\item Rewrote several server softwares from the ground up to be streamlined, greatly reducing latency and significantly reducing memory and CPU footprint
\item Developed a custom distributed server for devices connecting via a custom protocol
\item Designed an open-source C++11 API and library to abstract away a legacy protocol
\item Wrapped the above API using SWIG, for automated use in Android, iOS, Windows
\item Designed a hardware-independent embedded firmware in C++11

& \textbf{Virtual Reality} (cats-blender-plugin, OpenVR-AdvancedSettings, dolphin-vr, and more)& \\
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\parbox{\middleboxsize}{ \begin{itemize} 
\item Developed an open-source method for automatically producing optimized variants of any avatar by utilizing Blender's own internal rendering engine and a number of data manipulations, bringing production-quality models to the Oculus Quest/Android in a single step (Github: cats-blender-plugin, 'CATS Bake')
\item Allowed for instant generation of 'twist bones', animation helper bones that prevent models from distorting when twisting
\item Implemented a method for producing 30+ face-tracking shape keys instantly from traditional visemes, by detecting the upper/lower lips using a heuristic, then manipulating the existing transforms in different directions (VRCFaceTracking-blender-plugin)
\item Helping develop open source API-level methods for VR locomotion, including vestibular motion and redirected walking (on the Steam store: OVR Advanced Settings)
\item Managing the crossplatform work neccesary to run Dolphin VR (Gamecube emulator) on Linux, and assisting with the new official support via OSVR
\item Development of interfaces for Virtual Reality technology (Vuzix VR920, Wii, Oculus Rift DK1/DK2)

& \textbf{Machine Learning} (morewell, face\_recognition) & \\
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\parbox{\middleboxsize}{ \begin{itemize} 
\item Implemented a natural-language learning bot for a chat program which attempts to detect inflammatory messages via a neural network, forwarding them to an administrator chat
\item Sourced the above implementation to create a bot for a chat program that signs in as me, automatically learning what messages I'd be most interested in and notifying me when they are posted
\item Created a facial recognition command-line script that infers which face belongs to which user in a chatroom, automatically exporting VCARD contacts that can then be imported into a phone
