\textbf{Riverbed Technology, SF, CA}  (Software Engineer) & \textbf{October 2016 - Present} \\
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\parbox{\middleboxsize}{ \begin{itemize} 
\item Added both virtual and hardware interfaces to the abstraction layer for capturing network traffic, allowing traffic capture on AWS (virtual) and 40/100Gbit fiber (hardware) interfaces
\item Fine tuned several API functions, letting us export over several hundred time ranges at once instead of opening a socket for each, turning an operation which took minutes into seconds
\item Created hardware-specific profiles that forced certain processes on to certain CPUs in a multi-CPU system, ensuring the capture card was directly tied to the CPU
\item Added forced compiler checks that ensure success/fail return values are being consumed
\item Repackaged neccesary open-source software for our custom Redhat-based distribution
\item Cleared a considerable amount of legacy code that required explicitly initializing/deinitializing objects, letting the constructor do the work
\item Participated in regular code review and improvement, as well as triaging and reprioritizing bugs, assigning and updating estimates
\end{itemize} } } \\
& \textbf{Elk Products, Hickory, NC}  (Software Engineering Intern) & \textbf{May 2013 - October 2016} \\
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\parbox{\middleboxsize}{ \begin{itemize} 
\item Rewrote several server softwares from the ground up to be streamlined, greatly reducing latency and significantly reducing memory and CPU footprint
\item Developed a custom distributed server for devices connecting via a custom protocol
\item Designed an open-source C++11 API and library to abstract away a legacy protocol
\item Wrapped the above API using SWIG, for automated use in Android, iOS, Windows
\item Designed a hardware-independent embedded firmware in C++11
